MAIN

> [usability] look into Template Haskell for icky compile-time stuff (e.g. static vs. dynamic labels)
> [feature] implement bit (perhaps?)


FIXES


IMPROVEMENTS

> [usefulness] return choice of circuit implementation to "frontend" (i.e. let the user choose)
> [performance] Use of appends ends up generating bigger labels than necessary
> [haskellness] implement proper error handling instead of using "error"

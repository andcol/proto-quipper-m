FIXES


IMPROVEMENTS

> [code] try to merge KnownCtx and LabelCtx typeclasses (they basically represent the same thing)
> [usefulness] return choice of circuit implementation to "frontend" (i.e. let the user choose)
> [performance] Use of appends ends up generating bigger labels than necessary
> [haskellness] implement proper error handling instead of using "error"

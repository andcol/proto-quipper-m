FIXES

IMPROVEMENTS (performance, aesthetics, etc.)

> [usefulness] return choice of circuit implementation to "frontend" (i.e. let the user choose)
> [performance] Use of appends ends up generating bigger labels than necessary
> [haskellness] Implement proper error handling instead of using "error"

MAIN

> [test] box
> [feature] implement bit (perhaps?)


FIXES

> [correctness] enforce linearity of same-id labels (the very meaning of Q)
> [correctness] enforce empty linear context in Lift
> [decency] freshLabel should be implemented better
> [decency] should not use undefined to get a [WireType] out of MType t in Box


IMPROVEMENTS

> [correctness] pass a Proxy instead of a list to box in order to statically enforce correctness of inner type
> [usefulness] return choice of circuit implementation to "frontend" (i.e. let the user choose)
> [performance] Use of appends ends up generating bigger labels than necessary
> [haskellness] implement proper error handling instead of using "error"

MAIN

> [correctness] enforce linearity of same-id labels (the very meaning of Q)
> [usability] look into Template Haskell for icky compile-time stuff (e.g. static vs. dynamic labels)
> [test] box
> [feature] implement bit (perhaps?)


FIXES

> [decency] freshLabel should be implemented better (box)


IMPROVEMENTS

> [correctness] pass a Proxy instead of a list to box in order to statically enforce correctness of inner type
> [usefulness] return choice of circuit implementation to "frontend" (i.e. let the user choose)
> [performance] Use of appends ends up generating bigger labels than necessary
> [haskellness] implement proper error handling instead of using "error"
